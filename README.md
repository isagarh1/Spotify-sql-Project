# Spotify-sql-Project
I analyzed a Spotify dataset using SQL to extract meaningful insights about music streaming trends and track performance across platforms. The focus was on applying intermediate SQL concepts such as aggregation, filtering, joins, grouping, and window functions to solve real-world analytical problems.

**Data Exploration** 

Before diving into SQL, it’s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains 
attributes such as: 

• Artist: The performer of the track. 

• Track: The name of the song. 

• Album: The album to which the track belongs. 

• Album type: The type of album e.g: single or album. 

• Various metrics such as danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and more. 

**Querying the Data** 

• After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the 
data.

Queries are categorized into easy, medium, and advanced levels to help 
progressively develop SQL proficiency. 

**Easy Queries** 

  -Simple data retrieval 
  
  -filtering, and 
  
  -basic aggregations.
  
**Medium Queries** 

- More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins. 

**Advanced Queries**

•  Subqueries, Window functions, CTEs.

**Technology Stack** 

• Database: PostgreSQL 
• SQL Queries: DDL, DML, Aggregations, Joins, Subqueries, Window Functions 
• Tools: pgAdmin 4
